patties (makes four):

500g extra lean beef mince
1/2 onion finely chopped
100-150g breadcrumbs
1 egg
1/2 cup chopped jalapeno
1 tbsp oregano
2 tsp cayenne
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp sea salt
drizzle olive oil (helps with leaner mince)

four buns (suit y'self)

salad:

iceberg lettuce
roma tomato
canned beetroot

condiments:

tomato or bbq sauce
shredded colby


mix all the patty ingredients well in a large bowl, then make into four patties.  squeeze them to about 3/4" thick now rather than pressing them while cooking.



put the buns in the oven for a few mins till crisp, then butter them and add the salad.

heat up canola oil in frying pan over gas

put a couple of patties in the pan then cover with a lid.  you'll probably need less heat and they'll cook quicker than you think.  after a few mins (2-3 here) the patties will be browning on top, flip them then and add some cheese on top.  cover again and check in another few mins.

...that is of course if you don't have a barbecue, you know what to do if you do.

serve with ales or other beverage of choice
